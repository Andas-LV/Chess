                <h3>World Cup</h3>

                <p>
                  The Chess World Cup is a prestigious international chess
                  tournament organized by the International Chess Federation
                  (FIDE). The tournament is open to players of all nationalities
                  and features a knockout format. The first Chess World Cup was
                  held in 1988, and since then it has become a regular fixture
                  in the international chess calendar. The Chess World Cup is
                  usually held every two years, with the winner of the
                  tournament earning a spot in the Candidates Tournament, which
                  is the final stage of the World Chess Championship cycle. The
                  winner of the Candidates Tournament then goes on to challenge
                  the reigning World Chess Champion for the title. The Chess
                  World Cup is known for attracting many of the world's top
                  chess players, including current World Chess Champion Magnus
                  Carlsen. The tournament is also an opportunity for emerging
                  talent and players from smaller chess nations to showcase
                  their skills and compete at the highest level

                <h3>Championship</h3>

                <p>
                  The Chess Championship is the highest level of competition in
                  the game of chess, where the world's best players compete for
                  the title of World Chess Champion. The championship is
                  organized by the World Chess Federation (FIDE) and is held
                  every two years. The winner of the championship is considered
                  the strongest chess player in the world. The championship is
                  typically a match between the reigning champion and a
                  challenger who qualifies through various events such as the
                  Candidates Tournament, the World Chess Grand Prix, or the
                  World Cup. The format of the championship varies, but it
                  usually involves a series of games played over several weeks,
                  with the first player to reach a certain number of wins being
                  declared the champion.

                <h3>Olympic Series</h3>

                <p>
                  There is no official "Chess Olympic Series." However, chess is
                  included in the program of the biennial World Mind Sports
                  Games (WMSG), which is often referred to as the "Olympic
                  Games" of mind sports. The WMSG is organized by the
                  International Mind Sports Association (IMSA) and includes five
                  mind sports: chess, bridge, go, draughts (checkers), and
                  xiangqi (Chinese chess). The chess tournament at the WMSG
                  features individual and team events for men and women, with
                  players from around the world competing for gold, silver, and
                  bronze medals. The tournament uses the Swiss system of
                  pairings, where players with similar scores are matched
                  against each other in each round. Aside from the WMSG, there
                  are also other major team chess events such as the Chess
                  Olympiad, which is a biennial team tournament featuring
                  national teams from around the world. The Chess Olympiad is
                  the largest and most prestigious team chess event, with teams
                  competing for gold, silver, and bronze medals in separate
                  events for men and women.

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                  The history of chess is believed to have originated in
                  northern India in the 6th century AD. The earliest known form
                  of the game was called chaturanga, which means "four
                  divisions" in Sanskrit. The game was played on an 8x8 board
                  and featured four different types of pieces: the king, the
                  elephant (later replaced by the bishop), the horse, and the
                  foot soldier. Chaturanga spread throughout India and
                  eventually to Persia, where it underwent several
                  modifications, including the addition of the queen piece and
                  changes to the movement of some of the other pieces. The game
                  was known as shatranj in Persia and became popular in the
                  Muslim world and eventually in Europe. Chess became a popular
                  game among the nobility in Europe in the Middle Ages and the
                  Renaissance. In the modern era, the game has become popular
                  worldwide and is played at all levels, from casual games in
                  parks to international tournaments featuring the world's top
                  players.

              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="description">
              In Europe, the rules of shatranj were modified further, and the
              game evolved into the modern version of chess that we know today.
              Some of the changes included the ability for pawns to move two
              squares on their first move, the introduction of en passant
              capture, and the ability for the king to castle
